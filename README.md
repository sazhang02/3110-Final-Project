# CS-3110-Final-Project

## Stuck in the Desert
We intend to build an RPG top-down puzzle exploration game based on “[Stuck in the Sewers](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-stuck-in-the-sewers),” where the player is a character that can move up, down, left, and right on a grid to collect coins and move through pipes to different rooms. The player begins at a starting pipe and must find the exit pipe to move to the next level while moving around walls. The player’s goal is to navigate through the pipe maze and escape through the exit pipe with their coins. 

The most important functionality of our system is to persist local information between separate rooms and allow the client to freely navigate and interact with the rooms until they successfully complete the game.
